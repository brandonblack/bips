==Abstract==

This BIP describes a new tapscript opcode (OP_INTERNALKEY) which pushes the
taproot internal key to the stack.

==Specification==

When verifying taproot script spends having leaf version 0xc0 (as defined in
BIP342), OP_INTERNALKEY replaces OP_SUCCESS187 (0xbb). OP_INTERNALKEY pushes
the taproot internal key, as defined in BIP341, to the stack.

==Motivation==

===Key spend with additional conditions===

When building taproot outputs, especially those secured by an aggregate key
representing more than 1 signer; the parties may wish to collaborate on signing
with the taproot internal key, but only with additional script restrictions. In
this case, OP_INTERNALKEY saves 32 bytes of witness space.

===Mitigated control block overhead for scripts using hash locks===

In cases where script path spending is not desired, the internal key may be set
to a NUMS point whose bytes would otherwise be required in a tapscript. This
could be used with any hash locked transaction, for example, to save 32 witness
bytes.

==Reference Implementation==

==Backward Compatibility==

By constraining the behavior of an OP_SUCCESS opcode, deployment of the BIP can
be done in a backwards compatible, soft-fork manner. If anyone were to rely on
the OP_SUCCESS behavior of OP_SUCCESS187, OP_INTERNALKEY would invalidate their
spend.

==Deployment==

TBD
